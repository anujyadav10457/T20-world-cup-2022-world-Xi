#Cricket World Cup 2022 Data Analysis and Team Prediction
##Overview
This project aims to analyze data from the 2022 Cricket World Cup and use it to predict the best playing XI for a team. We have categorized players into five specific roles:

1. Powerhitter (Opener)  
2. Anchor (Middle Order)  
3. Finisher  
4. All-rounder  
5. Fast Bowler  
Using Power BI, we have created visualizations that highlight key performance parameters for players in each role. Our analysis differentiates performances based on the tournament stages, including the Qualifier stage and the Super 12 stage. Additionally, we have implemented a tooltips feature that provides detailed match-by-match performance records when hovering over a player's name.
