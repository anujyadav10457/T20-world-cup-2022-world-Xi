# Cricket World Cup 2022 Data Analysis and Team Prediction  
## Overview  
This project aims to analyze data from the 2022 Cricket World Cup and use it to predict the best playing XI for a team. We have categorized players into five specific roles:  

1. Powerhitter (Opener)  
2. Anchor (Middle Order)  
3. Finisher  
4. All-rounder  
5. Fast Bowler  
Using Power BI, we have created visualizations that highlight key performance parameters for players in each role. Our analysis differentiates performances based on the tournament stages, including the Qualifier stage and the Super 12 stage. Additionally, we have implemented a tooltips feature that provides detailed match-by-match performance records when hovering over a player's name.

## Key Performance Parameters  
### Opener  
1. Strike Rate  
2. Batting Average  
3. Average Balls Faced  
4. Boundary Percentage  

### Middle Order (Anchor)  
1. Strike Rate  
2. Batting Average  
3. Average Balls Faced  
4. Boundary Percentage  

### Finisher  
1. Strike Rate  
2. Batting Average  
3. Average Balls Faced  
4. Boundary Percentage  

### All-rounder
1. Strike Rate  
2. Batting Average  
3. Economy  
4. Bowling Strike Rate

### Fast Bowler  
1. Dot Balls Percentage  
2. Bowling Average  
3. Economy  
4. Bowling Strike Rate

## Visualizations in Power BI  
The Power BI project includes several visualizations designed to provide insights into player performance. The main features include:

Performance Metrics by Role: Visual representations of key parameters for each player role.  
Stage-Based Performance: Comparison of player performances in the Qualifier stage and Super 12 stage.  
Detailed Tooltips: Hovering over a player's name reveals their performance metrics for each match, using the tooltips feature.
